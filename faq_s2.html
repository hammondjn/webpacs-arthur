</h3><a name="#general1"><b>What are Arthur and MOBIUS?</b></a>
<p>
MOBIUS is a group (consortium) of over fifty libraries throughout
the state of Missouri that shares resources so patrons may borrow
books not owned by their local library.
</p>
<p>
ARTHUR is a cluster or group of Missouri libraries, within the
MOBIUS library consortium. It consists of six libraries in the
central Missouri area: Columbia College, Lincoln University, the
Missouri State Library, Stephens College, Westminster College,
and William Woods University.

</p><a name="#general2"><b>What do I do if Stafford Library does
not have the material I want? Can I get a book or a photocopied
article from another library?</b></a>
<p>
You can borrow books from any MOBIUS member library in person or
by requesting the book through the catalog system. You can get
books from outside the MOBIUS system by using Interlibrary loan.
</p>
<p>
While you cannot get photocopied articles from another library
through the MOBIUS system, you can get them through Interlibrary
Loan. Keep in mind that Interlibrary Loan can take anywhere from
a week to a couple of months.

</p><a name="#general3"><b>What is Interlibrary Loan?</b></a>
<p>
Interlibray Loan is the service through which patrons may borrow
and lend resources outside MOBIUS in order to provide patron
access to materials not held locally. Contact the library for
more information.

</p><a name="#general4"><b>When I request a book through MOBIUS it
asks for a campus ID number, what is my campus ID?</b></a>
<p>
Your campus ID is your student ID number with the Columbia Collge
Location added to the end of the number. The code for Columbia
College is CC. For example: 5555555CC.

</p><a name="#general6"><b>Can I go to another library and use
their resources?</b></a>
<p>
Yes, you can visit any MOBIUS member library, use their resources
and check out books. A list of libraries is available at
http://mobius.umsystem.edu/screens/libinfo.html. You can find the
hours of operation on their home pages. There are a few things to
keep in mind before you go:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the your student ID. If your ID card is not a picture ID
take a picture ID with you.
</li>
<li>Check with the Columbia College library before you go to make
sure your account is up to date. If your account is blocked for
overdue books, fines or any other reason, you will need to clear
that up before you can check out books at another library.
</li>
<li>Books are the only items you can check out from another
library. Nonbook items cannot be checked out from other libraries
than your own.
</li>
<li>Some libraries may allow you to use their periodical
collections, but may not allow you to use their databases. If you
need to use audiovisual equipment or materials, periodicals,
databases, or any other nonbook items check with the library in
question before you go.

<span style='font-size:7.5pt'><a href="#top">[back to

</p><a name="#general7"><b>Does the online catalog contain full
text journal articles?</b></a>
<p>
No, the online catalog lists magazines, newspapers, and journals
in the library. The catalog displays the location within the
library and what issues of that publication the library owns.
</p>
<p align="right" style=

<span style='font-size:7.5pt'><a href="#top">[back to
top]</a></span>
</p><a name="#general8"><b>How do I get full text journal
articles?</b></a>
<p>
Check with the library to find out what options you have. If the
library does not have the online or print full text of the
article you need, it may be able to get it for you through
Interlibrary Loan. Keep in mind that this may be a long process
often taking more than two weeks.

</p><a name="#general9"><b>How do I renew books?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Go to http://arthur.missouri.edu/search~.
</li>
<li>Scroll down to the bar that reads, "View your own library
record (Renew items)."
</li>

</li>
<li>Select the link that shows the number of items you currently
have checked out.
</li>
<li>You can choose to renew all items or renew selected items. If
you are only renewing some of the items, click on the box to the
left of the item you want to renew.
</li>
<li>Click on the appropriate button: "Renew all" or "Renew
selected items".
</li>
</ul>Important note: Not all items are renewable. Check the status

be a message showing the reason why not. Books from other
institutions can take time to renew. Check back after a while to
see if the renewal was successful. If you have questions or
problems, please call or e-mail the circulation department at your
library.

</p><a name="#general10"><b>What is My Reading History?</b></a>
<p>
You can keep track of what library items you have checked out and
have checked out in the past by activating the "My Reading
History" feature on your library account.

</p>
<p>
To activate your Reading History:

<p>
Access your library account, then click on My Reading History and
Opt In.

will not be listed. Please note: Items ordered through MOBIUS
will not be included in your Reading History.
</p>
<p>
To delete items or turn off your Reading History:
</p>
<p>
You can delete any or all of the items in your Reading History at
any time by using the Delete Marked or Delete All buttons. You
can also turn off the Reading History feature all together by
clicking the Opt Out button. Before doing so, however, you will
need to delete all entries from your Reading History.
